# Sprints State Management Task

This is a Flutter app demonstrating the use of BLoC (Business Logic Component) for state management. It includes:

- A `CounterBloc` to manage a counter value.
- A `ThemeBloc` to toggle between light and dark themes.
- Usage of `BlocListener`, `BlocBuilder`, and `BlocConsumer`.

## Features

- Increment counter using a floating action button.
- Toggle between light and dark themes.
- Show a SnackBar when the counter reaches 10 or multiples of 10.
